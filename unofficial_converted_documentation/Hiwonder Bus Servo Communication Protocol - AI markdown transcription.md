## 1. Summary
Using asynchronous serial bus communication method, theoretically, up to 253 robot servos can be connected into chain through the bus, you can unify control them through the UART asynchronous serial interfaces. Each servo can be set to a different node address, multiple servos can be unified or controlled independently. Communicating with the user's host computer software(controller or PC) through the asynchronous serial interface, you can set its parameters, function control. Sending instructions to servo through the asynchronous serial interface, the servo can be set to the motor control mode or position control mode. In the motor control mode, servo can be used as a DC reduction motor with adjustable speed; In the position control mode, servo has 0-240 degrees of rotation range with Plus ± 30 ° deviation adjustable range, in this range with precise position control performance, speed adjustable.

Half-duplex UART asynchronous serial interface which conforms to the protocol can communicate with the servo and control servo in different ways.

## 2. UART Interface schematic diagram
Servo uses the program code to perform the timing control to the UART asynchronous serial interface, realizes the half-work asynchronous serial bus communication, the communication baud rate is 115200bps, and the interface is simple, the protocol is simplified. In your own designed controller, the UART interface for communication with the servo must be handled as shown below.



## 3. Command Packet
Command packet format

**Table 1:**
| Header | ID number | Data Length | Command | Parameter | Checksum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x55 0x55 | ID | Length | Cmd | Prm 1... Prm N | Checksum |

- **Header**: Two consecutive 0x55 are received indicating the arrival of data packets.
- **ID**: Each servo has an ID number. ID number ranges from 0 ~ 253, converted to hexadecimal 0x00 ~ 0xFD.
- **Broadcast ID**: ID No. 254 (0xFE) is the broadcast ID. If the ID number issued by the controller is 254 (0xFE), all servos will receive instructions, but they all do not return the response message, (except for reading the servo ID number, Please refer to the following instructions for detailed instructions) to prevent bus conflict.
- **Length(data)**: Equal to the length of the data that is to be sent (including its own one byte). That is, the length of the data plus 3 is equal to the length of this command packet, from the header to the checksum.
- **Command**: Control the various instructions of servo, such as position, speed control.
- **Parameter**: In addition to commands, parameter are control informations that need to add.
- **Checksum**: The calculation method is as follows: `Checksum = ~(ID + Length + Cmd + Prm1 + ... + PrmN)`. If the numbers in the brackets are calculated and exceeded 255, Then take the lowest one byte, "~" means Negation.

## 4. Command type
There are two kinds of commands, write command and read command.
- **Write command**: normally, it followed by parameters, write the parameters of the corresponding function into the servo to complete a certain action.
- **Read command**: normally, it will not followed by parameters, when the servo received “read command”, it will return the corresponding data immediately, the returned command value with parameters is the same as the "read command" value that sent to the servo. So the PC software must immediately prepare to change itself to "read condition” after it sends the reading command.

The following table is command that the PC software send to servos.
